```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```
## Things I Learned 📚
* _I still have much to learn, but fail forward one shall_
* _I enjoy working from the cmd line/terminal, but i need a lot more practice navigating around etc_
* _Working in MongoDB - with Mongoose is nice, yet I still like MySQL I'm understanding they both have there case usage and both offer something to the world of DBMS_

## RoadMap 🧭 
* `Fix bugs/issues` 
* `Finish out this project to work properly` 
* `Refactor code to be more clean and efficient`
